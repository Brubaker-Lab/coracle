Correlations of Columns for Tidy Data \>\> "Corr" & "Col" \>\> "Coracle", a type of small boat.

## Installation

You can install the development version of coracle from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Brubaker-Lab/coracle")
```

This may fail for a variety of reasons.

## Loading

After installation, load the library with:

```{r}
library(coracle)
```

## Examples

The two main functions of `coracle` (`corr_col()` and `pcor_col()`) are written to accommodate different cases depending on the inputs.

### One Data Frame (`corr_col()`)

When `corr_col()` receives a single data frame (the required `x` argument) it does *pairwise correlation between all pairs of numeric columns within that data frame*.

Note: `pcor_col()` does not accept a single data frame.

For example:

```{r}
dfx <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_x = 1:5,
                  down_x = 5:1,
                  rand_x = runif(5))

corr_col(x = dfx)
```

Note:

-   Correlations are calculated for every combination of numeric columns.
-   Non-numeric columns (such as `index`) are excluded.
-   Correlations which could not be calculated return `NA` and a brief explanatory `message` (relayed from `stats::cor_test()`).
-   False discovery rate (FDR) q-values are automatically calculated.

### Two Data Frames (`corr_col()`)

When `corr_col()` receives two data frames (the `x` and `y` arguments) it does *pairwise correlation between all pairs of numeric columns between the two data frames*.

For example:

```{r}
dfx <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_x = 1:5,
                  down_x = 5:1,
                  rand_x = runif(5))
dfy <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_y = 1:5,
                  down_y = 5:1,
                  rand_y = runif(5))

corr_col(x = dfx, y = dfy)
```

Observe:

-   Every combination of a column from `x` and a column from `y` have their correlation calculated. No columns from `x` are correlated with other `x` columns. The same is true for `y`.
    -   Since there are three numeric columns in each data frame above, there are 9 total combinations in the result.
-   There are two additional FDR `q` columns: `q_x` and `q_y` (the default names). These are calculated *per grouping* of the `x` and `y` values, respectively. If `x` or `y` are renamed with `x_name` or `y_name` arguments, the `q_*` columns will be renamed to match.

### Three Data Frames (`pcor_col()`)

When `pcor_col()` receives three data frames (the `x`, `y`, and `z` arguments) it does *pairwise partial correlation between all pairs of numeric columns between `x` and `y` using all numeric columns of `z` as covariates*.

For example:

```{r}

library(dplyr)

dfx <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_x = 1:5,
                  down_x = 5:1,
                  rand_x = runif(5))
dfy <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_y = 1:5,
                  down_y = 5:1,
                  rand_y = runif(5))
dfz <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  rand_z = runif(5))

pcor_col(x = dfx,
         y = dfy,
         z = dfz)
```

### Naming Outputs

All `coracle` functions include `*_name` arguments to override the default column names ("x", "y", and "z") in the output.

For example:

```{r}

dfx <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_x = 1:5,
                  down_x = 5:1,
                  rand_x = runif(5))
dfy <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_y = 1:5,
                  down_y = 5:1,
                  rand_y = runif(5))

corr_col(
  x = dfx,
  y = dfy,
  x_name = "FIRST",
  y_name = "SECOND"
)
```

Observe:

-   The `q_*` columns of the output have also been renamed.

### Specifying Joins

By default, all `coracle` functions which accept two or more data frames as input attempt to join the data frames by columns of the same name found in each data frame.

For example:

```{r}
dfx <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_x = 1:5,
                  down_x = 5:1,
                  rand_x = runif(5))
dfy <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:5),
                  up_y = 1:5,
                  down_y = 5:1,
                  rand_y = runif(5))

corr_col(x = dfx, y = dfy)
```

Observe:

-   The function provides a message reporting on how the columns will be joined.

In some scenarios, this default behavior is not desirable. For example:

-   There may be one or more columns between the two data frames which share a name but would be inappropriate to use for joining.
-   There are no columns between the two data frames which share names.

To override this default behavior, provide a [`dplyr::join_by()` join specification](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join_by.html) to the appropriate `xy_join` and/or `xz_join` argument.

For example:

```{r}

library(dplyr)

dfx <- data.frame(i_x = as.character(1:5),
                  up_x = 1:5,
                  down_x = 5:1,
                  rand_x = runif(5))
dfy <- data.frame(i_y = as.character(1:5),
                  up_y = 1:5,
                  down_y = 5:1,
                  rand_y = runif(5))

corr_col(x = dfx,
         y = dfy,
         xy_join = join_by(i_x == i_y))
```

Observe:

-   Columns used to join data frames are excluded from the calculations.
    -   Since we joined by the "up" columns of each data frame (`u1` and `u2`), only the "down" (`d1`, `d2`) and "random" (`r1`, `r2`) columns are included in the result, for a total of 4 combinations.
-   The `xy_join` argument expects the output of `dplyr::join_by()` which can be assigned to another variable which is passed to the function or done directly in the `coracle` function call (as shown).

### Using `future` to Parallelize Calculations

By default, all `coracle` functions work with `future` plans in order to parallelize the calculation.

For example:

```{r}

n <- 100

dfx <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:n),
                  replicate(n, runif(n)))
dfy <- data.frame(i = as.character(1:n),
                  replicate(n, runif(n)))

library(future)
library(tictoc)

plan(sequential)

tic(msg = "Sequential function call")
result <- suppressMessages(corr_col(x = dfx, y = dfy, xy_join = join_by(i)))
toc()

plan(multisession) # Maximum workers available

tic(msg = "Parallel function call with maximum workers available")
result <- suppressMessages(corr_col(x = dfx, y = dfy, xy_join = join_by(i)))
toc()

plan(multisession, workers = 6)

tic(msg = "Parallel function call with 6 workers")
result <- suppressMessages(corr_col(x = dfx, y = dfy, xy_join = join_by(i)))
toc()

plan(multisession, workers = 4)

tic(msg = "Parallel function call with 4 workers")
result <- suppressMessages(corr_col(x = dfx, y = dfy, xy_join = join_by(i)))
toc()

plan(multisession, workers = 2)

tic(msg = "Parallel function call with 2 workers")
result <- suppressMessages(corr_col(x = dfx, y = dfy, xy_join = join_by(i)))
toc()

plan(sequential) # Reset plan

```

Observe:

- There is no one-size-fits-all plan and more workers are not always faster. Parallelization incurs overhead and, depending on the size of the data and the number of cores available, a faster plan may require some planning and/or trial and error.
